# Note
The current project is valid only for analyzing the single text at a time, where the text can prompted into a GUI created using 
[Tkinter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm#:~:text=Tkinter%20is%20the%20standard%20GUI,Tkinter%20is%20an%20easy%20task.) 
module in python. This really doesn't mean that you can't do more things with this, you can like example: make your own changes to the existing code and create 
a cool website, with rich UI that can take an entire csv file which consists of thousands of reviews.
