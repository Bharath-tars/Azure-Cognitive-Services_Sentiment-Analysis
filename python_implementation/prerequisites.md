# PREQUISITES
If you've come this far like got into [python_implementation](https://github.com/Cloud-Community-Group/Azure-Cognitive-Services_Sentiment-Analysis/tree/main/python_implementation) folder and reading this .md file, it shows that you're enthusiastic to get this project done.. well lets get going!!

## Introduction
The Prequisites for this project divided into two parts:
- [Training a Sentiment Analysis model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/tutorial-cognitive-services-sentiment)

Involves feeding large amounts of labeled data (text and their corresponding sentiment) into a machine learning algorithm or a deep learning model to learn how to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text data.
- [Accessing the Credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/)

obtaining the necessary authentication keys or tokens that are required to access the Azure Cognitive Services APIs. Once you have obtained the credentials, you can use them to make requests to the APIs and get back the desired results.
